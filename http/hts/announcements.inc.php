  <tr><td><?= $datauri ?>announcements/29</td><td><p>A new project to link the myExperiment system with two existing electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) systems developed in Southampton, currently in use in several departments, has been announced today (June 11, 2009). By integrating these ELNs with myExperiment we will pave the way for longer term takeup in the experimental laboratory science communities, including Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Engineering.<br />
<br />
The project will commence in July 2009 and will be led by Prof Jeremy Frey, who is based in the School of Chemistry at Southampton and is one of the partners in the myGrid Platform.<br />

  <tr><td class="shade"><?= $datauri ?>announcements/14</td><td class="shade"><p>We're pleased to announce that we've remodelled the myexperiment wiki to support the myExperiment developer community.</p>

<p>There is now a Developers' section where those of you developing over the API can share information about your projects.&nbsp; It currently includes Google gadgets, the Taverna plugin, workflows for Facebook and the Java API.&nbsp; This section also carries information about people running their own myExperiments, and myExperiment developer documentation.</p>
<p>The other information is now organised into Users, News and About. Previously you needed a wiki account to get at anything other than the main page, but now everything is publicly available, so you won't need to use your old accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really keen that everyone working over the API uses the wiki, if only to list who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing &ndash; then all the developers will be able to help out as the community grows.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>To get an account so that you can contribute content to the Developer pages please email Don Cruickshank on dgc@ecs.soton.ac.uk</p></td></tr>

  <tr><td><?= $datauri ?>announcement/3</td><td><p>In true 'perpetual beta' fashion, we continue our updates and additions to myExperiment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the user profile page, you can now see how many times a user has been credited for Workflows and Files in myExperiment. You can also see these credited items directly in the new &quot;Creditations&quot; tab, when viewing a user's profile.</li>
    <li>Clearer statistics in the Workflow, File and User pages.</li>
    <li>Improved layout for the Workflow and File pages.</li>
