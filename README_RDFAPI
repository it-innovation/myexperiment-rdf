README - Instructions for setting up myExperiment Linked Data Architecture (RDF API Only)
========================================================================================

1. Copy inc/defaultsettings.inc.php to inc/settings.inc.php and update values appropriately.


2. Copy 4store/scripts/default_settings.sh to 4store/scripts/settings.sh and adjust the values for STORE4_PATH and DATA_PATH so they point at where the 4store/ and data/ directories have been deployed on the server.


3. Run 4store/scripts/createLogFiles.sh, to create files and folders for logs.


4. Add the following cronjob for the user who has permission to the data/ directory:

   23 * * * * /bin/bash <LINKED_DATA_REPO>/4store/scripts/sqs.sh <TRIPLESTORE> manage-dataflows >> <LINKED_DATA_REPO>/4store/log/dataflows.log

Where the variable <LINKED_DATA_REPO> is where this codebase is checked out to and <TRIPLESTORE> is the value set of TRIPLESTORE in 4store/scripts/settings.sh.  Even though a triplestore is not being used this variable is need to tell the script where to put the RDF generated for dataflows.
