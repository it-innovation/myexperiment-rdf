1. Copy inc/defaultsettings.inc.php to settings.inc.php and update values appropriately.


2. Update http/.htaccess so that it points to the full path version .htpass file in this directory.


3. Create a triplestore using the 4s-backend-setup command

   e.g. 4s-backend-setup --cluster 8 <triplestore> 

   Take the name of the triplestore and copy that name into the appropriate parameters in inc/settings.inc.php and 4store/scrripts/settings.sh


4. Run 4store/scripts/createLogFiles.sh, 4store/scripts/createConfigFolders.sh and 4store/scripts/createDataFolders.sh to create files and folders for logs, config and data.
